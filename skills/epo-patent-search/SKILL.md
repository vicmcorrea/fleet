# EPO Patent Search Skill

Search European patents using the EPO Open Patent Services (OPS) API and Google BigQuery with EP country filtering.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when users ask to:
- Search for European patents
- Find EP prior art for a technology
- Check legal status of EP patents
- Explore patent families across jurisdictions
- Conduct EP freedom-to-operate analysis
- Research the EP patent landscape for a technology area
- Get full-text EP claims or descriptions

## What This Skill Does

Provides access to European patent data through two methods:

1. **EPO OPS API** (European Patent Data):
   - Full-text EP patent retrieval (claims, description)
   - Legal status and procedural history
   - INPADOC patent family linking
   - Applicant and inventor search
   - EP publication types (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2)
   - Designated contracting states

2. **BigQuery** (Worldwide Patents, EP Filter):
   - Fast keyword search across 100M+ patents with country="EP"
   - CPC classification search for EP patents
   - Filing trend analysis
   - Cross-jurisdiction comparison

## Required Setup

### BigQuery (Primary)

**Prerequisites**:
1. Google Cloud Project (free to create)
2. BigQuery API enabled
3. Application Default Credentials configured

**Setup**:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
```

### EPO OPS API (Optional, for full-text/legal status)

**Prerequisites**:
1. Register at https://developers.epo.org/
2. Create an application to get Consumer Key and Secret
3. Set environment variables

**Setup**:
```bash
export EPO_OPS_CONSUMER_KEY=your-key
export EPO_OPS_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-secret
```

## How to Use

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Determine search type**:
   - Keyword search: use BigQuery with country="EP" for speed
   - Full-text retrieval: use EPO OPS for complete claims/description
   - Legal status: use EPO OPS for procedural data
   - Family search: use EPO OPS INPADOC family service
   - CPC search: use BigQuery for broad classification browsing

2. **Execute search**:

   **BigQuery keyword search (EP patents)**:
   ```python
   results = search_patents_bigquery(
       query="blockchain authentication",
       country="EP",
       limit=20,
       start_year=2020
   )
   ```

   **BigQuery CPC search (EP patents)**:
   ```python
   results = search_patents_by_cpc_bigquery(
       cpc_code="H04L9/32",
       country="EP",
       limit=30
   )
   ```

   **EPO OPS full-text retrieval**:
   ```python
   results = search_epo_patents(
       query="EP3456789",
       search_type="full_text"
   )
   ```

   **EPO OPS family search**:
   ```python
   results = search_epo_patents(
       query="EP3456789",
       search_type="family"
   )
   ```

3. **Present results**:
   - Rank by relevance
   - Show key metadata (title, applicant, dates, IPC/CPC)
   - Highlight legal status (in force, expired, opposed)
   - Provide links to Espacenet for full documents
   - Note patent family members in other jurisdictions

## Search Result Format

```python
{
    "publication_number": "EP3456789A1",
    "title": "Authentication system using distributed ledger",
    "abstract": "A system for authenticating...",
    "applicant": "Example GmbH",
    "inventors": ["Hans Mueller", "Maria Schmidt"],
    "filing_date": "2019-03-15",
    "publication_date": "2020-01-22",
    "grant_date": null,
    "ipc_codes": ["H04L9/32", "G06F21/31"],
    "cpc_codes": ["H04L9/32", "G06F21/31"],
    "designated_states": ["DE", "FR", "GB", "NL", "IT"],
    "priority_claims": ["US16/234567 (2018-12-28)"],
    "family_id": "67890123",
    "legal_status": "Examination in progress",
    "publication_type": "A1"
}
```

## EP Publication Types

| Code | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| A1 | Application + search | Published EP application with search report |
| A2 | Application only | Published without search report |
| A3 | Search report | Search report published separately |
| B1 | Granted patent | Patent specification as granted |
| B2 | Amended patent | Amended specification after opposition |
| B3 | Limited patent | Patent after limitation proceedings |

## Cross-Jurisdiction Linking

Use `family_id` to find related patents across jurisdictions:

```
EP3456789A1 (European application)
├── US10123456B2 (US counterpart)
├── CN112345678A (Chinese counterpart)
├── JP2020-123456A (Japanese counterpart)
└── WO2019/123456A1 (PCT application)
```

This is essential for:
- Prior art analysis (one patent may be available in multiple languages)
- Freedom-to-operate (check where patent is in force)
- Competitive intelligence (track filing strategy)

## Presentation Format

Present search results as:

```
