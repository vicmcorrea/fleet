## What changed in the port

The port is editorial, not mechanical. See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for the full per-skill audit of substitutions applied.

Summary of structural changes:

- Plugin content lives at `plugins/pstack/` (with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). The repo root holds `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and the LICENSE / NOTICE / README / CHANGES docs.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` added at repo root so the repo is installable via `/plugin marketplace add`. The marketplace's single plugin entry sources from `./plugins/pstack`.
- `plugins/pstack/commands/<name>.md` stubs added so each public skill is reachable as a slash command in Claude Code.
- Seven skills imported from `cursor-team-kit`: `deslop`, `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `fix-ci`, `fix-merge-conflicts`, `get-pr-comments`, `what-did-i-get-done`. All copied verbatim — no rewiring needed.
- `plugins/pstack/skills/babysit/` is independently authored as the Claude Code analog of Cursor's `/babysit` built-in. It has no upstream pstack equivalent; its workflow is informed by Cursor's public `/babysit` behavior. No code or prose was copied from any source.
- `plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/scripts/` is vendored from upstream (`watch-pr`, `orch`, `bootstrap.ts`, `worktree-audit.sh`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`) with three edits: `worktree-audit.sh` reads `~/.claude/projects/` instead of Cursor's transcript directory and warns when `jq` or `rg` is missing (their absence silently blanks the columns the prune decision reads), and the private workspace package is renamed `@pstack-claude/poteto-mode-tools`. Everything else is upstream's code under the same MIT license.
- `plugins/pstack/agents/comment-sicko.md` is upstream's `Comment Sicko` agent, renamed to `comment-sicko` so the name works as a Claude Code `subagent_type`. The body is verbatim.
- A Codex build shares the same `skills/` tree. It adds `plugins/pstack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, a root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, and `plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md` (the Claude-to-Codex tool, model, and built-in map), plus a one-line Platform note in the skills that name a Claude primitive. The skill content itself is unchanged. See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md#codex-port).

## Modifications

Per the MIT license, modifications are permitted. Skill bodies have been edited to substitute Cursor-specific primitives with their Claude Code equivalents (the full substitution table is in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md)). All upstream copyright notices in source files (where present) are preserved.
